# Overview
In this analysis we built a table using UFO Sighting data stored in a JavaScript array. By creating filters to make this table fully dynamic by reacting to user input, and then placing the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Finally, customizing the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that allow users to interact with the visualizations. 
This way, users are able to filter through hundreds of UFO sightings. 

# Result
In order to perform a search using this interactive table, there are five filters/criteria a user can take into consideration in order to narrow down their search of UFO Sightings: Date, City, State, Country, State. These filters allow the user to interact with the table so that only the specified criteria inputted appear.
Below is an example of the filters without any criteria inputted, the light-grey colored text show an example of the type of information that can be inputted in each filter:
